This repository contains the implementation for the ENFIELD Exchange Scheme project: **"Formal Adversarial Testing of LLM-Generated Code for Industrial Robots"**. The project aims to develop a testbed for detecting safety violations in industrial robot code (specifically ABB RAPID) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on ISO 10218 standards.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements. This project is designed to run in a **Dockerized environment** to ensure reproducibility, but the host system needs specific configurations.

### 1. Operating System
* **Host OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) is strictly recommended.
* *Note for VM Users:* If you are running Ubuntu on VirtualBox or VMWare, ensure **3D Acceleration** is enabled and at least **8GB RAM** / **4 CPU Cores** are allocated.

### 2. Core Tools
You must have the following tools installed on your host machine:

* **Git:** For version control.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```
* **Docker Engine & Docker Compose:**
    The entire simulation and testing environment runs inside Docker containers.
    * [Install Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
    * [Linux Post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) (Crucial: Manage Docker as a non-root user).

### 3. ROS2 Humble (Optional but Recommended for Host)
While the project runs in Docker, having ROS2 Humble installed on the host is useful for native debugging and visualization (Rviz2).
* **Distribution:** ROS2 Humble Hawksbill
* [Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)

### 4. Hardware/Drivers (For Simulation)
* **GPU Drivers:** If you plan to run Gazebo or Isaac Sim with high performance, ensure proprietary NVIDIA drivers are installed on the host.
    ```bash
    nvidia-smi  # Check if drivers are correctly installed
    ```
